Report for Lab 1
----------------

After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Jiayang(JY) Li

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I don't think the entire assignment is terribly hard in terms of actual coding. It's the
large code base that makes it hard to navigate through the different parts and take into
consideration those different pieces when I wrote one class.

The part about bit manipulation is new to me, but the tutorial is very helpful!

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Coming up with the right data structure and manipulating bits.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

I don't think there is any.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

About 3 hours.
