1. Explain how you modified SynchronizedThreads in exercise 1.
	
	only run incrementer in a synchronized statement on the shared counter so that the current running
	incrementer thread owns the lock on counter and other threads cannot increment the counter.

2. Briefly describe (1-2 sentences) an alternate implementation for exercise 1.

	Another way to is to make Counter.increment() method synchronized by just adding a "synchronized" keyword.

3. Exercise 2: Explain the deadlock that happens in Deadlock in terms of locks and threads waiting on locks. The two threads in this case are alphonse and gaston. 

a) What objects are being locked? 

b) Who has what locks? 

c) How does deadlock occur?

4. Return to exercise 1, can deadlock occur here?  Explain why or why not.

5. Explain why acquireLock uses a synchronized statement inside the body of the method. In other words, why not just make the acquireLock method synchronized, just like releaseLock? Will this work? Why or why not?
