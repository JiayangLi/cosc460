Questions
---------

Answer these questions.  With each question is a hint as to which part of the code walk you might consult to find the answer.

(Walk thru 1) How many instances of the TableStats class are created?

	The number of tables in the catalog.

(Walk thru 4) In class, we said a logical plan is a relational algebra tree.  That's not how it's represented in SimpleDB.  How is it represented?

	A logical plan is a collection of scan nodes, filter nodes, join nodes and select, in addition to an aggregate and group by field. 

(Walk thru 5) The physicalPlan is a relational algebra tree.  Describe the basic shape of this tree in terms of which ops go where.

	The operations in the tree are (from bottom to top): seqscan on base tables, filter(relational algebra select), join and project.

(Walk thru 5) Suppose a query applies multiple filters to a single table.  For example, the query described in the lab write up filters on both actor first and last name.  In such cases, how is the selectivity estimated?  

	Prior to any filter, the filterSelectivity for a table is 1.0 because of the seqscan. As the first filter is applied to the table, the selectivity for this specific filter predicate is first calculated using the
	table's stats. Then the new filterSelectivity will be the product of the previous filterSelectivity and selectivity for this specific filter that we have just calculated. This process repeats for every filters on 
	one table. The final filterSelectivity of a table is the product of the selectivity of all filters on this table.
	
(Walk thru 5) Explain the meaning of this if statement.  Why should the subplanMap have size 0 or 1 at this point?

    if (subplanMap.size() > 1) {
        throw new ParsingException("Query does not include join expressions joining all nodes!");
    }
    
    At this point, all the joins should have been parsed, subplanMap should only have one iterator that encompasses all the operations except aggregation.
    This iterator is at the second highest level of the tree, directly feeding tuples into the top project. 

(Walk thru 7) What does computeCostAndCardOfSubplan do when the joinSet contains only a single join, the joinToRemove?

	It will just estimate the cost of joining the two base relations in the joinToRemove.
	
(Walk thru 9) Suppose we are considering a join between a table A and the result of a join between B and C.  Assume table A is the outer relation in the join.  What is the cost estimate?  Your expression should be in terms of the sizes (# pages, # tuples) of the base relations A, B, C.

(Walk thru 10) In lab 3, you write Join and Filter operators.  Both of these support the DbIterator interface.  When/where are these iterators called?
	
	When executing a query, the execute() method keeps calling next() method on the physcial plan iterator; the next() method then invokes next() method of its children which are joins and filters to get the next tuple of the query result.
